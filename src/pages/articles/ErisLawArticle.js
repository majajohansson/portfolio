      <StyledH2>Kick-off</StyledH2>
      <StyledParagraph>I started by conducting interviews. I wanted to know the business goals as well as learn more about the users. The law firm is for companies and not private people, which was a fun and new challenge for me.</StyledParagraph>

      <StyledH2>Prototyping</StyledH2>
      <StyledParagraph>When I had gotten to know the end users better and what their needs were, I created a site map. It helped me to see all the pages that I would need to design.</StyledParagraph>
      <StyledParagraph>I created prototypes made out of simple wireframes to start testing with users. The prototypes were improved and tested again iteratively.</StyledParagraph>
      <StyledParagraph>When we had a good frame for the whole website I started to put colours, typography and other visuals into place. I created several designs with different themes to choose between. We also asked around to hear which design other people preferred.</StyledParagraph>
      <StyledParagraph>When everything was set it was implemented by developers.</StyledParagraph>
